## Development Notes

For my first commit, I opened an issue and pushed to main without opening a PR. Apologies for that.

With more time, I would have:
- Added more functionality to the table (sorting by columns and values)
- Extracted the CSS into a separate file and used classnames or something similar
- Ensured compatibility for all screen sizes
- Overall UI enhancements such as smooth scroll, etc,
